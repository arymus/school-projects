    <h3>Gaining a Understaning about the Circle of Design!</h3>
    <p>The engineering design process begins by defining a problem and completing background research on the problem. Requirements are specified and a solution is chosen. A prototype of the solution is built and then tested. If the solution built meets the requirements then the results can be shared.</p>
    <p>Design goes beyond aesthetic. Thinking like a designer means pulling disparate observations and requirements together and using them to inspire yourself to create a harmonious innovation to improve the world. </p>
